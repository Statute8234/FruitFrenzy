# Rating

The project showcases basic Pygame game development concepts, including event handling, animation, and user interface design. However, it lacks polish and refinement, with simple graphics, rudimentary gameplay mechanics, and lack of sound effects and visual feedback. Although a decent introduction to Pygame programming, it falls short in providing a fully immersive gaming experience.
